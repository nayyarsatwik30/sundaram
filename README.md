# Cross-Chain Token Swap

## Project Description

**Cross-Chain Token Swap** is a decentralized protocol that facilitates token swapping between different blockchains. The primary goal of this project is to enable seamless cross-chain interactions, allowing users to transfer tokens between different blockchain networks via smart contracts.

## Smart Contract Address

- **Contract Address:** [0x8b3b125633a5E81F2DB8206EB2fC7ae2F9F9AFf9](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8b3b125633a5E81F2DB8206EB2fC7ae2F9F9AFf9)

## Features

- **Cross-Chain Token Swap:** Facilitates seamless token transfer between different blockchain networks (simulation of token bridging).
- **Token Initiation:** Allows users to initiate token transfers, simulating the bridging process between chains.
- **Transfer Completion:** Handles the simulated completion of token transfers when they are received on the destination chain.
- **Deposit and Withdrawal:** Users can deposit tokens into the contract and withdraw them as needed.

## How It Works

1. **Initiating a Transfer:**
   - A user can initiate a token transfer to another address, simulating a cross-chain swap. The contract logs the event and deducts tokens from the sender's balance.
   
2. **Completing a Transfer:**
   - Once tokens are transferred (in real-world bridging scenarios), the receiving address can claim tokens, updating their balance on the contract.

3. **Deposit and Withdrawal:**
   - Users can deposit tokens into the contract and withdraw them, simulating interactions between the user's wallet and the contract.

## Contract Code

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract CrossChainSwap {

    // Mapping to store balances of users (for token bridge tracking)
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    // Event for token transfer initiation
    event TransferInitiated(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 amount, uint256 timestamp);

    // Event for successful token transfer completion
    event TransferCompleted(address indexed to, uint256 amount, uint256 timestamp);

    // Method to simulate initiating a token transfer (sending tokens to a cross-chain bridge)
    function initiateTransfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        // Ensure sender has enough balance to send
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

        // Update sender's balance
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;

        // Log the transfer initiation event (for tracking)
        emit TransferInitiated(msg.sender, to, amount, block.timestamp);

        // Simulate the actual cross-chain transfer (this is a placeholder for real bridge logic)
        // Here you would interact with a bridging protocol to lock tokens and send them cross-chain.
    }

    // Method to simulate completion of cross-chain transfer (tokens received on destination chain)
    function completeTransfer(address from, uint256 amount) public {
        // Increase recipient's balance after successful transfer
        balances[from] += amount;

        // Log the transfer completion event
        emit TransferCompleted(from, amount, block.timestamp);
    }

    // Helper function to add tokens to the sender's balance (simulating deposits)
    function deposit(uint256 amount) public {
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    // Helper function to withdraw tokens
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }
}
